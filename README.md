I want to learn more about security as a backend developer. So i am going to organize and describe all about my learning.

### Main idea (for now):

Make a password keeper api.

### Techs:

- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] Express
- [ ] Postgres or MongoDB
- [ ] Docker

### To study

I will organize documents about each question and its responses, trying to teach what I learned. 

- [x] How to use nmap to discover ports running  
- [ ] What exactly is Metasploit
- [ ] How to use Metasploit
- [ ] How to try penetrate a Node.JS server
- [ ] Wich authentication method is more secure?
- [ ] How to implement the authentication method
- [ ] How E2E cryptography works
- [ ] Is it possible to work with E2E in this app?
- [ ] What more modules can I add to the app for better security exploration?
